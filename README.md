####Task_1, Week_2 at Makers Academy

**Goal is to rewrite Inject method of Array class by using two approaches:**

- using iterator

- using recursion

To solve that problems I've created two separate test files for two ways of solving a problem.

Run my inject in irb:

```
require './lib/my_inject_recusion'

require './lib/my_inject_iterator'

```
